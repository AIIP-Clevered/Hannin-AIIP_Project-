# Covid Premonitor 

It is an app designed to warn you against Covid. 
The avatar asks a series of yes or no questions and gives advice according to the user's replies. The app also reminds the user about some essential things. When the app thinks the user is safe to go out, the avatar changes to a mirroring of the user's eyes, nose, and wrists. It says 'stop touching your faceâ€™ when the user touches their face.
1. It forewarns or gives a premonition based on the answers given by the user, and so is "Covid Premonitor"
2. The App is created to be used by adults and kids alike, and so the avatar is a friendly-looking girl! The UI is designed to be simple and effective.
3. Integrates speech recognition (to help the differently-abled and little kids to navigate through with ease)
